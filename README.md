-This project is a real-time disease detection system designed to assist in medical screening, especially in large-scale health camps. Using a Random Forest Classifier, the system predicts possible diseases based on symptoms provided by patients. It aims to support quick preliminary diagnosis and reduce the burden on healthcare professionals.



Key Features:-

  -Real-time symptom-based disease detection

  -Trained using machine learning (Random Forest Classifier)

  -User-friendly interface for easy input and access

  -Suitable for large-scale, on-the-spot medical screenings

  -Built using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and streamlit (or Flask, if used)

  

Technologies Used:-

  -Python

  -Scikit-learn

  -Pandas

  -Streamlit / Flask (based on your interface)
 
  -Random Forest Classifier

  

Use Case:-
  -Primarily designed for use in medical camps, where there is a need to screen a large number of patients quickly. The system assists in early-stage disease detection and helps prioritize further medical attention.
